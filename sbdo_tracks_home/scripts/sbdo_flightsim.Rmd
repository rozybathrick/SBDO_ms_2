```{r}
library(aniMotum)
library(tidyverse)
library(AICcmodavg)
```

## Step One

Load the data

```{r}
get(wd)
sbdo_22<-read.csv("raw_data/9.29.22_fall_22_animotum.csv")
```

## Step Two 

Fit a correlated random walk: movements are random and correlated in direction and magnitude. The movement persistence can happen later

Experiment at different timesteps to find the best fit 

### 24 hour timestep
```{r}

fitcrw24_speed <-
  fit_ssm(
    x = sbdo_22,
    model = "crw",
    time.step = 24,
    vmax=20,
    control=ssm_control(verbose=0))

plot(fitcrw24_speed, what="fitted")
plot(fitcrw24_speed, what="predicted")

```
