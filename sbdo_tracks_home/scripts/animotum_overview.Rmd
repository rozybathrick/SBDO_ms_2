## Disclaimer

This vignette is an extended set of examples to highlight `aniMotum`'s functionality. Please, do NOT interpret these examples as instructions for conducting analysis of animal movement data. Numerous essential steps in a proper analysis have been left out of these vignettes. It is your job to understand your data, ensure you are asking the right questions of your data, and that the analyses you undertake appropriately reflect those questions. We can not do this for you!


### Models

This is an overview of how to use `aniMotum` to filter animal track locations obtained via the Argos satellite system or (possibly) another tracking system. `aniMotum` provides three state-space models (SSM's), two for filtering (ie. estimating "true" locations and associated movement model parameters, while accounting for error-prone observations), and another for filtering and estimating move persistence - an index of movement behaviour:

-   a simple *Random Walk* model, `rw`
-   a *Correlated Random Walk* model, `crw`
-   a *Move Persistence* model, `mp`

the models are continuous-time models, that is, they account for the time intervals between successive observations, thereby naturally accounting for the often irregularly-timed nature of animal tracking data. We won't dwell on the details of the models here (see Jonsen et al. 2020 for details on the `crw` model), except to say there may be advantages to choosing one over the other in certain circumstances. The *Random Walk* model tends not to deal well with small to moderate gaps (relative to a specified time step) in observed locations and can over-fit to particularly noisy data. The *Correlated Random Walk* model can often deal better with these small to moderate data gaps and appropriately smooth through noisy data but tends to estimate nonsensical (i.e., 'looping' artefacts) movement through longer data gaps, especially when animals are mostly stationary during those gaps. The *Move Persistence* model can be more robust to data gaps up to a point, and estimates time-varying move persistence $\gamma_t$ along the track, which provides an index of how an animal's movement behaviour varies in space and time based on the autocorrelation of successive movements. If you have Argos location data and your goal is to infer changes in movement behaviour along tracks then estimating locations and move persistence simultaneously within a state-space model is the preferred approach, as location uncertainty is accounted for in the move persistence estimates.

Additionally, `aniMotum` provides separate models (`mpm`, `jmpm`) for estimating move persistence *after* fitting either the `rw` or `crw` SSM (see Jonsen et al. 2019 for details). Using the `fit_mpm` function, the `mpm` is fit to individual tracks, whereas the `jmpm` is fit to multiple tracks simultaneously with a variance parameter that is estimated jointly across the tracks. This latter model may better resolve subtle changes in movement behaviour along tracks that lack much contrast in movements. Both models can be fit to time-regularized locations or to time-irregular locations. See Auger-Méthé et al. (2017) for an example of the latter. These models can be fit to animal tracks, regardless of the geolocation technology used, but they assume that locations are known without error.


### Data

`aniMotum` can accept input data in several possible formats. Here, we outline the default formats but users are not restricted to using these. Input data with variable names and/or column ordering that differs from the defaults can be used, provided the essential minimum data elements are present to allow the SSM's to be fitted: a unique animal/track identifier, date-time of each observation, location quality class, and longitude and latitude (or projected x and y) coordinates. We expand on these and additional variables in the following sections. 

A pre-processing function `format_data()` can be used to correctly structure the input data for use in `aniMotum`. This function checks for the presence of the essential variables, converts date-time to `POSIX` format, maps custom variable names onto the default names, and puts the variables into the default column order expected by `aniMotum`. Users may choose to call `format_data()` themselves, prior to fitting an SSM with `fit_ssm()`, or they can allow `fit_ssm()` to format the data automatically. We illustrate these approaches in the "Fitting a model" section, below.


#### Argos Least-Squares (LS) location data
We'll start out with the original Argos data, CLS Argos' Least-Squares-based (LS) locations. These data contain the minimum information required by `aniMotum`'s SSM's. A minimal input `data.frame` or `tibble`, containing only the information required to fit the SSM, looks like this:

```{r data 1, echo = FALSE}
data(sese, package = "aniMotum")
head(data.frame(sese))
```

The (default) column names represent the following:  
- `id` a unique identifier for each animal (or track) in the `data.frame`  
- `date` a date-time variable in the form `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS` (or `YYYY/mm/dd HH:MM:SS`). These can be text strings, in which case `aniMotum` converts them to `POSIX` format and assumes the timezone is `UTC`. If the date-times are from a local timezone then you must specify this via the `tz` argument to `format_data()`. A list of valid timezone names can be viewed via `OlsonNames()`.  
- `lc` the location class variable common to Argos data, with classes in the set: 3, 2, 1, 0, A, B, Z.  
- `lon` the longitude variable  
- `lat` the latitude variable  
The `lc` values determine the measurement error variances (based on independent data, see Jonsen et al. 2020) used in the SSM's for each observation.


#### Argos Kalman Filter (KF) location data
Since 2011, the default Argos location data uses CLS Argos' Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm. These data include error ellipse information for each observed location in the form of 3 variables: ellipse semi-major axis length, ellipse semi-minor axis length, and ellipse orientation. A minimal input `data.frame` or `tibble` for Argos KF data looks like this:

```{r data 2, echo = FALSE}
data(ellie, package = "aniMotum")
head(data.frame(ellie))
```

The column names follow those for Argos LS data, with the following additions:  
- `smaj` the Argos error ellipse semi-major axis length (m)  
- `smin` the Argos error ellipse semi-minor axis length (m)  
- `eor` the Argos error ellipse ellipse orientation (degrees from N)  

Here, the error ellipse parameters for each observation define the measurement error variances used in the SSM's (Jonsen et al. 2020). Missing error ellipse values are allowed, in which case, those observations are treated as Argos LS data. 


#### GPS location data
The `aniMotum` SSM's can be fit to GPS location data, for example to deal with (rare) extreme locations and/or to time-regularise locations. The input data format is the same as for Argos LS data, but the `lc` class is set to `G` for all GPS locations:

```{r data 3, echo = FALSE}
  data.frame(
  id = rep("F02-B-17", 5),
  date = seq(Sys.time(), by = "1 hours", length.out = 5),
  lc = rep("G", 5),
  lon = seq(70.1, by = 0.5, length = 5),
  lat = seq(-49.2, by = 1, length = 5)
  )
```


#### Light-level geolocation data
The `aniMotum` SSM's can be fit to processed light-level geolocation data, when they include longitude and latitude error SD's (`lonerr`, `laterr`; units in degrees). In this case, the `lc` class is set to `GL` for all geolocation observations:

```{r data 4, echo = FALSE}
  data.frame(
  id = rep(54632, 5),
  date = seq(Sys.time(), by = "12 hours", length.out = 5),
  lc = rep("GL", 5),
  lon = seq(100, by = 0.5, length = 5),
  lat = seq(-55, by = 1, length = 5),
  lonerr = rexp(5, 1 / 0.5),
  laterr = rexp(5, 1 / 1.5)
  )
```

We caution users, that light-level geolocation errors can be (highly) non-Gaussian, depending on the species, tag technology, and algorithm used to estimate location from the light-level data. For example, we have observed strongly non-Gaussian location uncertainty in tracks of highly migratory tunas that traverse very different water masses in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Because `aniMotum`'s SSM's assume bi-variate Normal location errors, fitting to geolocations with non-Gaussian errors would not be appropriate and likely result in highly biased location estimates. Geolocation data collected from birds may be less prone to this issue, but we urge users to explore both the uncertainty in their tracking data and the algorithm used to estimate locations from light-level data.


#### Projected location data
Users can provide projected location data as an `sf-tibble` or `sf data.frame`. By default, `aniMotum`'s SSM's fit to locations that are transformed to the Mercator projection (EPSG 3395) and estimated locations are back-transformed to spherical coordinates (lon, lat). When an `sf`-projected data set is supplied, the `aniMotum` SSM's are fit to locations on the supplied projection (`aniMotum` ensures that distance units are set to km). Here is an example `sf-tibble` Argos data set in a polar stereographic projection:

```{r data 5, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
data(ellie, package = "aniMotum")
foo <- sf::st_as_sf(ellie, coords=c("lon","lat"), crs = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs") 
foo <- sf::st_transform(foo, crs = "+proj=stere +lat_0=-60 +lon_0=85 +ellps=WGS84 +units=km +no_defs")
head(foo)
```


#### A mixture of location data types
Users can fit SSM's to data where a combination of Argos, GPS or light-level geolocation observations are inter-mixed. Below is an example of mixed Argos KF and GPS observations, as one might obtain from a double-tagged individual:
```{r data 6, echo = FALSE}
  data.frame(
    id = rep("F02-B-17", 5),
    date = c("2017-09-17 05:20:00", "2017-10-04 14:35:01", "2017-10-05 04:03:25", "2017-10-05 06:28:20", "2017-10-05 10:21:18"),
    lc = c("G","2","G","A","B"),
    lon = c(70.1, 70.2, 70.1, 71.1, 70.8),
    lat = c(-49.2, -49.1, -49.3, -48.7, -48.5),
    smaj = c(NA, 1890, NA, 28532, 45546),
    smin = c(NA, 45, NA, 1723, 3303),
    eor = c(NA, 77, NA, 101, 97)
  )
```

These mixtures are possible because the `aniMotum` SSM's apply the most appropriate measurement error model for each observation, based on its location class and error information (i.e., numeric values vs NA's).


### Fitting a model

Model fitting for quality control of locations is comprised of 3 steps: a data formatting step, a pre-filtering step, and the actual model fitting step. A number of checks are made on the input data during the formatting and pre-filtering steps, including applying the `trip::sda` filter to identify extreme observations (see `?fit_ssm` for details). The pre-filter step is fully automated, although various arguments can be used to modify it's actions, and called via the `fit_ssm` function:

```{r fit_ssm, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## format, prefilter and fit Random Walk SSM using a 24 h time step
fit <-
  fit_ssm(
    x = ellie,
    model = "rw",
    time.step = 24
  )
```

These are the minimum arguments required: the input data, the model (`rw`, `crw`, or `mp`) and the time.step (in h) to which locations are predicted. Additional control can be exerted over the data formatting and pre-filtering steps, via the `id`, `date`, `lc`, `coord`, `epar` and `sderr` variable name arguments, and via the `vmax`, `ang`, `distlim`, `min.dt`, and `spdf` pre-filtering arguments (see `?fit_ssm` for details). The defaults for these arguments are quite conservative (for non-flying species), usually leading to relative few observations being flagged to be ignored by the SSM. Additional control over the optimization can also be exerted via the `control = ssm_control()` argument, see see `vignette('SSM_fitting')` and `?ssm_control` for more details.

#### Custom data formats
Users do not need to adhere to the default `aniMotum` data formatting presented above, so long as their input data contain the essential variables. The variables can have arbitrary names and be in any order. Here is an example using a custom formatted `data.frame` of Argos LS data as input:

```{r fit_ssm2, message=FALSE}
data(sese2_n)
sese2_n
```

Note the columns are in a different order than the default expected by `aniMotum`, and the first three variables have different names: `longitude`, `latitude` and `time`. There are two approaches to format these data. The first, is to call `format_data` as a data pre-processing step prior to fitting an SSM. The data are linked to the expected names via the following arguments to `format_data`: `id`, `date`, `lc`, `coord`, `epar` and `sderr`. In this example, we only need to use the `date` and `coord` arguments:

```{r format_data1, message=FALSE}
d <- format_data(sese2_n, date = "time", coord = c("longitude", "latitude"))
d
```

We then fit the SSM to the formatted data `d` via `fit_ssm`:

```{r fit_ssm3, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fit <- fit_ssm(d,
               model = "crw",
               time.step = 24)
```

Alternatively, we can use a shortcut and have `fit_ssm` format the `sese2_n` data by adding the variable name arguments to the call:
```{r fit_ssm4, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fit <- fit_ssm(sese2_n,
               date = "time",
               coord = c("longitude","latitude"),
               model = "crw",
               time.step = 24)
```

Original variable names are not preserved in the output object `fit` but rather transformed to the default expected names. The `grab` function can be used to access the data and the SSM estimates (see Access Results, below).

`fit_ssm` can be applied to single or multiple tracks, without modification. The specified SSM is fit to each individual separately and the resulting output is a compound `tibble` with rows corresponding to each individual `ssm_df` fit object. The `converged` column indicates whether each model fit converged successfully.

```{r multi-fits, message=FALSE}
## fit to data with two individuals
fit <- fit_ssm(sese2,
               model = "crw",
               time.step=24,
               control = ssm_control(verbose = 0))

## list fit outcomes for both seals
fit
```

Individual `id` is displayed in the 1st column, all fit output resides in a list (`ssm`) in the 2nd column, `convergence` status (whether the optimizer found a global minimum) of each model fit is displayed in the 3rd column, whether the Hessian matrix was positive-definite and could be solved to obtain parameter standard errors (`pdHess`) is displayed in the 4th column, and the specified process model (`rw`, `crw`, or `mp`) in the 5th column. In some cases, the optimizer will converge but the Hessian matrix is not positive-definite, which typically indicates the optimizer converged on a local minimum. In this case, some standard errors may be calculated but not all. One possible solution is to try specifying a longer `time.step` or set `time.step = NA` to turn off predictions and return only fitted values (location estimates at the pre-filtered observation times). If `pdHess = FALSE` persists then careful inspection of the supplied data is warranted to determine if suspect observations not identified by `prefilter` are present. The excellent [glmmTMB troubleshooting vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmmTMB/vignettes/troubleshooting.html) may also provide hints at solutions. Convergence failures should be examined for potential data issues, however, in some cases changes to the optimization parameters via `ssm_control()` (see `?fit_ssm` and `?ssm_control` on usage) may overcome mild issues (see `?nlminb` or `?optim` for details on optimization control parameters).


### Access results

Summary information about the fit can be obtained via the `summary` function:

```{r fit summary fn, message=FALSE}
summary(fit)
```

The summary table lists information about the fit, including the number of observations in the input data (`n.obs`), the number of observation flagged to be ignored by the SSM (`n.filt`), the number of fitted location estimates (`n.fit`), the number of predicted location estimates (`n.pred`), the number of rerouted location estimates (if present, `n.rr`), model convergence status, and AICc. When fitting to multiple individuals, these statistics are repeated on separate lines for each individual. Separate tables of SSM parameter estimates and their SE's are also printed for each individual. The parameter estimates displayed vary depending on the SSM process model selected by the user (`rw`, `crw`, or `mp`) and the automatically chosen measurement model(s). Here, `sigma_x` and `sigma_y` are the process error standard deviations in the x and y directions, `rho_p` is the correlation parameter in the covariance term. The `Std. Error` column lists the standard errors, calculated via the Delta method (see TMB documentation for details), for each estimated parameter.

`fit_ssm` usually returns two sets of estimated locations in the model fit object: fitted values and predicted values. The fitted values occur at the times of the observations to which the SSM was fit (i.e., the observations that passed the pre-filter step). The predicted values occur at the regular time intervals specified by the `time.step` argument. If `time.step = NA`, then no predicted values are estimated or returned in the model fit object.

Users can obtain the fitted or predicted locations as a data.frame by using `grab()`:

```{r grab estimated locations, message=FALSE}
## grab fitted locations
floc <- grab(fit, what = "fitted")
floc[1:5,]

## grab predicted locations in projected form
ploc <- grab(fit, what = "predicted", as_sf = TRUE)
ploc[1:5,]
```

Here, the output from the `crw` SSM is returned as a fitted location data.frame (floc) that includes individual id, date, longitude, latitude, x and y (typically from the default Mercator projection) and their standard errors (`x.se`, `y.se` in km), `u`, `v` (and their standard errors, `u.se`, `v.se` in km/h) are estimates of signed velocity in the x and y directions. The `u`, `v` velocities should generally be ignored as their estimation uses time intervals between consecutive locations, whether they are observation times or prediction times. The columns `s` and `s.se` provide a more reliable 2-D velocity estimate, although standard error estimation is turned off by default as this generally increases computation time for the `crw` SSM. Standard error estimation for `s` can be turned on via the `control` argument to `fit_ssm` (i.e. `control = ssm_control(se = TRUE)`, see `?ssm_control` for futher details).

The predicted location data.frame (ploc) is an `sf-tibble` with geometry and Coordinate Reference System information. This `sf` output format can be useful for custom mapping or calculating derived variables from the estimated locations.

The formatted and prefiltered version of the input data can also be extracted from the output:

```{r grab data, message=FALSE}
fp.data <- grab(fit, what = "data")
fp.data[1:5,]
```

Here, `fp.data` is in the form that is passed to the `crw` SSM. The first 5 columns (`id`, `date`, `lc`, `lon`, `lat`) are preserved from the formatted input data, and the error ellipse parameter columns (`smaj`, `smin`, `eor`) are appended and filled with NA's, if missing from the input data. The observation type, `obs.type`, is determined for each observation during the prefiltering stage based on the combination of `lc` value and the presence of error ellipse parameters with non-NA values. The `keep` column indicates whether each record passed the pre-filtering stage (see `?prefilter` for details), observations with `keep = FALSE` are ignored by the SSM. The `x`,`y` columns are the Mercator-projected coordinates (in km) that fitted to by the SSM. The `emf.x` and `emf.y` columns are the error multiplication factors used to scale the measurement error variances, used by the SSM, for each Argos Least-Squares location class - these are relevant only for `obs.type = 'LS'` and for GPS observations.


### Visualising a model fit

A generic `plot` (see `?plot.ssm_df`) method allows a quick visual of the SSM fit to the data:

```{r fit plot1, eval=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# plot time-series of the fitted values
plot(fit, what = "fitted", type = 1, pages = 1)
```
![](images/overview/fit_plot1.jpg){width=95%}
Here, the fitted values (state estimates corresponding to the time of each observation; orange points) are plotted on top of the observations that passed the `prefilter` stage (blue points and blue rug at bottom) and as separate time-series for the x and y coordinates by default. Uncertainty in the estimates is displayed as 2 x SE intervals (orange-filled ribbon). Observations that failed the `prefilter` stage are also displayed (black x's and black rug at bottom).  

A 2-D time series plot of the track is invoked by the argument `type = 2`:
```{r fit plot2, eval=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# plot fitted values as a 2-d track
plot(fit, what = "predicted", type = 2, pages = 1)
```
![](images/overview/fit_plot2.jpg){width=95%}
The predicted values (orange points) are the state estimates predicted at regular time intervals, specified by `time.step` (here a 24 h interval). 95 % confidence ellipses (orange-filled ellipses) around the predicted values are also displayed, but can be faded away by choosing a low `alpha` value (e.g., `plot(fit, what = "predicted", type = 2, alpha = 0.05)`). Observations that failed the `prefilter` stage are displayed (black x's) by default but can be turned off with the argument `outlier = FALSE`).
